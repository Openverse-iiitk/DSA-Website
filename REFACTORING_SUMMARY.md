# DSA-Website Feature-Based Architecture Refactoring Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the refactoring of the DSA-Website project into a feature-based architecture. The refactoring aimed to improve code organization, maintainability, and make the project structure more intuitive.

## Changes Made

### 1. Directory Structure Reorganization

The project now follows a feature-based architecture with the following structure:
```
src/
  ├── features/             # All features grouped by functionality
  │   ├── about/            # About page feature
  │   ├── common/           # Shared components and styles
  │   ├── home/             # Home page feature
  │   ├── linkedList/       # Linked List visualization feature
  │   ├── pathfinding/      # Pathfinding visualization feature
  │   ├── sorting/          # Sorting visualization feature
  │   ├── stackQueue/       # Stack & Queue visualization feature
  │   └── tree/             # Tree visualization feature
  ├── assets/               # Shared assets
  ├── constants/            # Application constants
  ├── lib/                  # Library code
  └── utils/                # Utility functions
```

Each feature folder contains:
- `components/`: UI components specific to the feature
- `styles/`: CSS files for the feature
- `utils/`: Utility functions specific to the feature

### 2. Import Path Fixes

Fixed import paths across all files to match the new directory structure.

### 3. Helper Function Updates

- Added backward compatibility for `generateMemoryAddress` function
- Ensured all helper functions are property exported and imported

### 4. CSS Organization

- Created a central `common.css` for shared styles
- Moved feature-specific styles to their respective folders
- Consolidated styles that were spread across multiple files

### 5. Created Test Files

- Added a proper test file for the Tree component in `/tests/tree-component-test.js`
- Removed empty test files

### 6. Cleanup

- Removed duplicate directories and files
- Eliminated unnecessary backup files
- Organized CSS files into the feature folders they belong to

## Benefits

1. **Better Maintainability**: Related code is now grouped together
2. **Clearer Structure**: Each feature has its own dedicated area
3. **Easier Navigation**: Components are organized intuitively
4. **Improved Scalability**: New features can be added in a consistent way

The project is now successfully refactored and all features are working as expected.
