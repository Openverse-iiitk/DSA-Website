# Recursion Visualizer

A comprehensive educational tool that visualizes recursive algorithms through interactive tree diagrams, call stack visualization, and step-by-step code execution.

## Features

### ðŸŒ³ **Visual Tree Representation**
- **Binary Tree Layout**: Shows the recursive call structure as a tree where each node represents a function call
- **Node States**: Different visual states for active calls, completed calls, and base cases
- **Color Coding**: 
  - Orange nodes indicate base cases
  - Blue glowing nodes show the currently active call
  - Green nodes represent completed calls with results

### ðŸ“š **Call Stack Visualization**
- **Real-time Stack**: Shows the current state of the call stack during execution
- **Frame Information**: Displays function name, parameters, and current line number
- **Stack Growth**: Visual representation of how the stack grows and shrinks during recursion

### ðŸ’» **Interactive Code Display**
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Clean, readable C code with proper formatting
- **Line Highlighting**: Current execution line is highlighted during animation
- **Step Descriptions**: Detailed explanations of what's happening at each step

### ðŸŽ® **Animation Controls**
- **Play/Pause**: Control animation playback
- **Step Forward/Backward**: Manual step-through for detailed analysis
- **Speed Control**: Adjustable animation speed (slider from slow to fast)
- **Reset**: Return to the beginning of the algorithm

## Supported Algorithms

### 1. **Fibonacci Sequence**
```c
int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n <= 1)        // Base case
        return n;      // Return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2);
}
```
- **Purpose**: Classic recursive example showing exponential branching
- **Complexity**: O(2^n) time, demonstrating the inefficiency of naive recursion
- **Educational Value**: Perfect for understanding how recursion creates a tree structure

### 2. **Greatest Common Divisor (Euclidean Algorithm)**
```c
int gcd(int a, int b) {
    if (b == 0)        // Base case
        return a;      // Return a
    return gcd(b, a % b);
}
```
- **Purpose**: Efficient recursive algorithm with linear depth
- **Complexity**: O(log min(a, b)) time
- **Educational Value**: Shows how recursion can be efficient with proper problem reduction

### 3. **Fast Exponentiation (Exponentiation by Squaring)**
```c
int power(int base, int exp) {
    if (exp == 0) return 1;    // Base case
    if (exp == 1) return base; // Base case
    if (exp % 2 == 0) {
        int half = power(base, exp/2);
        return half * half;
    }
    return base * power(base, exp-1);
}
```
- **Purpose**: Optimized recursive algorithm using divide-and-conquer
- **Complexity**: O(log exp) time compared to O(exp) naive approach
- **Educational Value**: Demonstrates how clever recursion can achieve logarithmic complexity
